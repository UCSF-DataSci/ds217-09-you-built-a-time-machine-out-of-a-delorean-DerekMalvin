TODO: Document your timezone operations:

- What timezone was your original data in? 
The original timezone information was not included and instead was showing as a calendar data (ex. '2023-01-01). 

- How did you localize the data?
I localized the data to UTC through the use of tz_localize('UTC'). This changes the original date format, which didn't account 
for time, to now account for time. On top of that, it now accounts for it in UTC.

- What timezone did you convert to?
After localizing the data to UTC, I converted the time to US/Eastern timezone via tz_convert('US/Eastern').

- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
Using the UTC avoids all of the DST issues such as observing daylight savings time and so as a result, there is no "spring forward" or "fall back" that can cause issues of duplication in the future. 

- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion
Current: 
UTC: {utc_time} 
Eastern: {eastern_time}

After Changing:
Original:{patient_vitals.index[0]}
UTC Localized: {patient_vitals_tz.index[0]}
Eastern: {patient_vitals_tz_eastern.index[0]}

- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data
UTC is the recommendation for the base timezone for storing temporal data for a few reasons. The first
reason is that UTC does not take into account for daylight savings time transitions, which takes away the 
difficulties that come with having to convert these times. The second reason why it is recommended is beacause 
it provides a single, consistent reference point for all countries in the world to follow. This way, data collected
from New York, Tokyo, or London will not have to worry about converting all of these into one, since it does it already.
