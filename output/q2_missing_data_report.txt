TODO: Document your missing data handling:
- How many missing values did you find?
There was a total of 323 missing values.

- What percentage of data was missing?
Approximately 96.4 percent of the data was found to be missing.

- Which method did you use to fill missing values?
The method that I used is the time-based linear interpolation using the interpolate(method='time') 
method to fill the missing values.

- Why did you choose that method?
I chose the time-based interpolation method because it is the most appropriate method for this healthcare 
temperature data. One of the main reasons why I chose this is because body temperature is a biological
measurement that changes gradually over time rather than a sudden spike. Time-based interpolation allows for
a smooth transitions between monthly values and that also is a good representation of how the body temperature
behaves. I also chose this because it keeps the trends true and accurate without having to introduce any artificial
data that could disrupt the analysis.


- What are the pros/cons of your approach?
There are a few pros and cons that come with using the time-based interpolation method. The first pro that 
I want to note is that it gives a smooth set of numbers that doesn't have any random jumps in it. As a result,
it is much easier to visualize and understand. The second pro is that it feels much more realistic for body
temperature.This is because temperature typically doesn't spike up or down drastically in the span of a day. 
The first con that I have for this approach is that it will assume that everything changes linearly. The second con
that I have for this approach is that it can't guess for anything that is outside of the existing timeframe. For
example, it will not be able to tell me what happened before the first measurement and what will happen after the
last measurement.
